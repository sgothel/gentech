
The riverproblem is that monks and canibals must cross the river in
an way, so that the canibal number is never greater as the monk number
on both riversides - except only canibals exist on one riverside.
The boat is able to transport up to two persons, but one person as the minimum.

The genetic algorythm, which solves the riverproblem in this application,
is designed and implemented in C++ with complete virtual classes.

you can compile the code with GNU-C++ V 2.7.2
under linux with ´make -f makefile.linux´,
or under Cygnus-Gnu-Win32-B19 with ´make -f makefile.cygwin32b19´.

You need the packages ´jaulibs.zip´ and ´gentech.zip´ also !
============================================================

The directory structor for compiling must be:

	./jaulibs
	./jau/gentech.lib
	./jau/gen-river
