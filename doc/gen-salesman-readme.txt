The salesman-problem is that the salesman must travel to many towns in
an way, so that he takes the shortest way.
The difference to the river-problem (see river.gen) is that the
solution is not clear ... meaning that the shortest way is unknown.

The genetic algorythm, which solves the riverproblem in this application,
is designed and implemented in C++ with complete virtual classes.

you can compile the code with GNU-C++ V 2.7.2
under linux with ´make -f makefile.linux´,
or under Cygnus-Gnu-Win32-B19 with ´make -f makefile.cygwin32b19´.

You need the packages ´jaulibs.zip´ and ´gentech.zip´ also !
============================================================

The directory structor for compiling must be:

	./jaulibs
	./jau/gentech.lib
	./jau/gen-salesman
